CosmicBulkMap: Resolving the Local Dipole AnisotropyAuthors: Iván Sheligo, Gemini (Google), ChatGPT (OpenAI)Repository: github.com/ivansheligo/CosmicBulkMap (¡Recuerda actualizar este enlace!)Project GoalThis repository contains the full analysis pipeline and results for the paper "Observational Resolution of Local Dipolar Anisotropy" (Sheligo, Gemini, & ChatGPT 2025, to appear on arXiv).Our objective is to perform a robust, independent analysis of the cosmic bulk flow by measuring the dipolar anisotropy in the Hubble-Lemaître diagram using two of the most comprehensive and recent datasets available:Pantheon+: A compilation of Type Ia Supernovae.CosmicFlows-4: A catalog of peculiar velocities.We provide all necessary code, data links, and explanatory notebooks to ensure our analysis is transparent, reproducible, and extensible by the scientific community.Getting Started: A 5-Minute DemoThe best way to understand our methodology is to run the demonstration notebook. It walks you through the core concepts of the analysis using a small, manageable dataset.➡️ Open the Demo Notebook: notebooks/example_analysis.ipynbThis notebook will show you how to:Load and visualize cosmological data.Understand the physically-motivated model for a dipole anisotropy.Generate a sky map of the bulk flow signal (the "CosmicBulkMap").How to ContributeWe welcome contributions from the community! Whether you want to report a bug, suggest an improvement, or add a new analysis module, please feel free to:Open an Issue: Discuss the change you would like to make.Fork the Repository: Create your own copy of the project.Create a Pull Request: Submit your changes for review.Please check our Contribution Checklist inside the demo notebook for specific ideas on where you can help.Core DependenciesThe analysis relies on the standard Python scientific stack:numpypandasmatplotlibastropyhealpyA requirements.txt file will be provided for easy installation via pip.LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
