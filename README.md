## Project Goal

This repository contains the full analysis pipeline and results for the paper  
**"Observational Resolution of Local Dipolar Anisotropy"**  
(Sheligo, Gemini, & ChatGPT 2025, to appear on arXiv).

Our objective is to perform a robust, independent analysis of the cosmic bulk flow by measuring the dipolar anisotropy in the Hubbleâ€“LemaÃ®tre diagram using two of the most comprehensive and recent datasets available:

- **Pantheon+:** A compilation of Type Ia Supernovae.
- **CosmicFlows-4:** A catalog of peculiar velocities.

We provide all necessary code, data links, and explanatory notebooks to ensure our analysis is **transparent, reproducible, and extensible** by the scientific community.

## Getting Started: A 5-Minute Demo

The best way to understand our methodology is to run the demonstration notebook.  
It walks you through the core concepts of the analysis using a small, manageable dataset.

- ðŸ““ **Open the Demo Notebook:**  
  `notebooks/example_analysis.ipynb`

This notebook will show you how to:
- Load and visualize cosmological data.
- Understand the physically-motivated model for a dipole anisotropy.
- Generate a sky map of the bulk flow signal (the "CosmicBulkMap").
